# YeldorGrid
I tried to find a layout manager in JavaFX that would allow me to place any node I would like in a cartesian coordinate fashion,
Yet I could not find one. I decided to make my own which allows the definition of columns, rows, and cell size in the constructor of the class.
As well as such, there are useful methods that can be used to locate nodes and such.

I recommend using this class for small games, yet I believe this will work on all kinds of applications. 

I re-created the classic game snake using this code ( https://github.com/Yeldor/Snake- )

I prefered this over the grid layout as the grid layout manager did not have true XY coordinates (that i know of at least). 
Just pasing around nodes and such. 

This code can be used for anything!
